# todo
# air resistance? linear and/or rotational ---- do calculations
# patches where there was contact on the container
# measure all physical parameters:
# container_amplitude
# container_radius
# density
# coefficient_of_restitution
# gamma_t (viscous damping coefficient)
# mu (coefficient of friction)
# todo optimise for speed (side goal)
# instead of v1 + v2 do np.add(v1, v2) or try the v1.add(v2)? check speed
# todo 0.5? 1? what is the stepping? how exactly does the verlet work
# todo tiny tiny bit of randomness in the collision forces (more realistic)? Do this after checking energy
# todo container patches
